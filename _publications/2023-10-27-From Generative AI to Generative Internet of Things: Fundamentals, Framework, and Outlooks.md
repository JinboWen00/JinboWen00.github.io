**Abstract:** Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) possesses the capabilities of generating realistic data and facilitating advanced decision-making. By integrating GAI into modern Internet of Things (IoT), Generative Internet of Things (GIoT) is emerging and holds immense potential to revolutionize various aspects of society, enabling more efficient and intelligent IoT applications, such as smart surveillance and voice assistants. In this article, we present the concept of GIoT and conduct an exploration of its potential prospects. Specifically, we first overview four GAI techniques and investigate promising GIoT applications. Then, we elaborate on the main challenges in enabling GIoT and propose a general GAI-based secure incentive mechanism framework to address them, in which we adopt Generative Diffusion Models (GDMs) for incentive mechanism designs and apply blockchain technologies for secure GIoT management. Moreover, we conduct a case study on modern Internet of Vehicle traffic monitoring, which utilizes GDMs to generate effective contracts for incentivizing users to contribute sensing data with high quality. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme. Finally, we suggest several open directions worth investigating for the future popularity of GIoT.
