In this paper, we first design a user-centric privacy-preserving framework based on decentralized Federated Learning (FL) for healthcare metaverses. To further improve the privacy protection of healthcare metaverses, a cross-chain empowered FL framework is utilized to enhance sensing data security. This framework utilizes a hierarchical cross-chain architecture with a main chain and multiple subchains to perform decentralized, privacy-preserving, and secure data training in both virtual and physical spaces. Moreover, we utilize Age of Information (AoI) as an effective data-freshness metric and propose an AoI-based contract theory model under Prospect Theory (PT) to motivate sensing data sharing in a user-centric manner. This model exploits PT to better capture the subjective utility of the service provider.
