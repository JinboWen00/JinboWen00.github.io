**Abstract:** Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) is a rapidly evolving field that utilizes advanced AI algorithms to generate content. Through integration with mobile edge networks, mobile AIGC networks have gained significant attention, which can provide real-time customized and personalized AIGC services and products. Since blockchains can facilitate decentralized and transparent data management, AIGC products can be securely managed by blockchain to avoid tampering and plagiarization. However, the evolution of blockchain-empowered mobile AIGC is still in its nascent phase, grappling with challenges such as improving information propagation efficiency to enable blockchain-empowered mobile AIGC. In this paper, we design a Graph Attention Network (GAT)-based information propagation optimization framework for blockchain-empowered mobile AIGC. We first innovatively apply age of information as a data-freshness metric to measure information propagation efficiency in public blockchains. Considering that GATs possess the excellent ability to process graph-structured data, we utilize the GAT to obtain the optimal information propagation trajectory. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme exhibits the most outstanding information propagation efficiency compared with traditional routing mechanisms.
